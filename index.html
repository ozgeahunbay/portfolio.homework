    <h2>More about Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Özge Ahunbay and I am 24 years old. I graduated from the University of Minnesota
        Twin Cities in 2023 with a bachelors degree in Global Health. I love to travel, and I have 
        been solo traveling around Asia for a couple months at a time once a year for the past 2 
        years. I grew up in Wisconsin, and I am
        living there now. I am working as a pharmacy tech as I take a coding bootcamp class.
        I think that I will be really good at web development if I keep learning it. I am 
        Turkish, and my parents moved to America from Turkey before I was born. I have gone to 
        Turkey almost every summer since I was born. I love going to Turkey because the food is 
        really good and the stray cats are super cute. I am fluent in English and Turkish, and I am 
        pretty darn good at Spanish as well. Some of my hobbies include working out, spending
        time in nature, and painting. Please hire me!
